                <h4>About this Study</h4>
                <p>
                    We are <a href="#whoareyou">two researchers</a> with <a href="https://wwww.ucc.ie" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">University College Cork</a> and
                    <a href="https://www.lero.ie" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lero, the Irish Software Research Centre</a>.
                    We are studying management challenges in InnerSource. For this research, we are conducting an "expert panel" study,
                    using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi_method" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Delphi study design</a>.
                    We seek to recruit approximately 25 panelists who have expertise and experience in InnerSource, with diverse backgrounds.
                    If you're interested in this study, please read on!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Participation would require a total time commitment of approximately 3 times 1 hour over the coming few months.
                    The study is conducted in three rounds, and each round takes about 1 hour within a time window of about 2 weeks -- that is,
                    once we start a round, we ask you to respond within 2 weeks.
                    Participation is anonymous. The overall process is shown in the figure below. In Round 1, we will ask you to provide
                    input on our first prompt, namely, to identify challenges that you have encountered (now or in the past) in the
                    management of InnerSource projects. Aggregated results will be fed back into Round 2, and so on.

                <p>
                    <a id="#anonymous"><b>Q: Will my participation be anonymous?</b></a>
                    A: Yes, your participation and provided input will be anonymous. If you prefer, we can name you in any resulting publication of this research as a participant,
                    but this is fully optional, and we will ask you when we write up the study.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <a id="#data"><b>Q: What will you do with my data?</b></a>
                    A: We ask you for input for this study in three rounds. All data will be stored in a safe place,
                    approved by the university (a university specific instance of Microsoft OneDrive instance).
                    The data will be stored there for 10 years. All data will be anonymized. When we receive the data, we analyze it for patterns using qualitative
                    data analysis procedures (e.g. "thematic coding"). We're trying to make sense of common themes, and link them together so that we can combine different
                    perspectives, and identify salient factors that might play a role in the issues that you and other experts discuss.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <a id="#needtoknow"><b>Q: If it's anonymous, why do you need to know who I am?</b></a>
                    A: We need to know who you are, beause we need to (1) ensure that you are in fact an InnerSource expert (to guarantee the scientific validity of the study),
                    and (2) we need to demonstrate that we have your permission to collect your data, by means of a <a href="data/delphi-consent.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">participant consent form</a> that we ask participants to sign.
                    Researchers such as us rely on the goodwill of participants, and so we take ensuring your anonymity (if you need it) very seriously - we couldn't do our job otherwise in the future.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <a id="why"><b>Q: Why would I participate?</b></a>
                    A: Participating in this study is voluntary, of course. Participating helps us to conduct research on InnerSource, and as such helps "the greater good". But participating also
                    can help you: you will get insights from others (also anonymized), and you're able to respond and provide comments on others' responses. So it can be very interesting to learn from others.
                    Participating can also help you as a way to reflect on, and write down your own experiences. Writing things down is useful, because that helps to think about it further, to "theorize"
                    about what you're doing, what your challenges are. It can also be a nice way to "vent"; to share your experiences and frustrations with others. See it as free therapy :-) (but we hope your frustrations aren't *that* bad!)
                </p>
                <p>
                    <a id="how"><b>Q: How do I participate</b></a>
                    A: If we haven't already contacted you, please register your interest in the study using <a href="https://forms.gle/XmrdKzB5xoKs9sXN9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this Google Forms form</a> (university-specific instance of Google Drive). We'll make a selection of participants, and then kick off with the first round of data collection in May 2022.
                    All interactions will be over email, because that's an easy and standard way to communicate. If you forget to respond in time, we'll send you a gentle reminder. We do wish to
                    emphasize the importance of staying involved for all three rounds.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <a id="ethics"><b>Q: Does this study have ethics approval?</b></a>
                        A: Yes, it has ethics approval from the Social Research Ethics Committee at University College Cork. This means that the
                        study design was reviewed by two anonymous reviewers, to ensure that the study protocols follow correct procedure, and that
                        proper procedures are in place to store the data in a safe place. All data will be stored in a safe place approved by the university for a period of 10 years.
                        All data will be anonymized. If you have any concerns of any kind regarding this study, you are welcome to contact us.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <a id="consent"><b>Q: Why do I have to sign a Participant Consent form?</b></a>
                        A: The ethics approval committee requires us as researchers to ensure that we have your written consent, and so if you agree to participate,
                        we'll ask you to sign and send us a <a href="data/delphi-consent.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Participant Consent Form</a>. These will be stored in a safe place,
                        approved by the university (University College Cork). In particular, it's a university-specific instance of Microsoft OneDrive.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <a id="time"><b>Q: How much time will I have to invest when participating?</b></a>
                        A: We expect a total time commitment of 3 hours, spread over 3 rounds of 1 hour each. It's important for the success of this study that if you decide
                        to participate, that you complete all three rounds. In Rounds 2 and 3, we'll ask you to read our aggregate results, as your input is requested based on that.
                        We expect Round 1 to run in May 2022, Round 2 about 4-5 weeks later, and Round 3 another 4-5 weeks. If you have annual leave/holidays planned during June-August, we should be able
                        to work around that, unless you go on a 2-month hiatus traveling the world...
                </p>
                <p>
                    <a id="findings"><b>Q: What are you going to do with the findings?</b></a>
                        A: As researchers, we will write up the results of this study and submit this to a peer-reviewed conference or journal for publication.
                        In the "Related Publications" section on the righ-hand side of this webpage, you'll find two examples of Delphi studies,
                        published in
                        <a href="https://cora.ucc.ie/bitstream/handle/10468/7040/7989.pdf?sequence=4&isAllowed=y" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ICSE 2016</a>
                        and
                        <a href="https://opus4.kobv.de/opus4-fau/files/13519/barcomb-2020-managing.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TSE 2022</a>
                        The first
                        one focused on the question how open source developers adopt tools and processes; the second focuses on the management of episodic volunteers.

                    <a id="whoareyou"><b>Q: Who are you?</b></a>
                        A: We are Yogeshwar Shastri and Klaas-Jan Stol. Yogeshwar, or Yogi for short, is a senior postdoctoral researcher working on a project called <a href="https://user-group.github.io/sodaw.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"Software Development with
                        Alternative Workforces" (SODAW)</a>. Yogi's based in New Zealand. Previously, Yogi published research on the role of the project manager in agile software development; see the
                        article published in
                        <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0164121220302612?casa_token=HvzigUpt_U0AAAAA:_EVnGdaO8vAdRc_u_cC8XHTbdZeKpozna4kRfqe3BqBIFSIUhtAC332DmlhJVKg3LTlNyTXh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Journal of systems and Software (2021)</a>
                        (listed in the "Related Publications" section on this webpage).
                        Klaas is the principal investigator on the SODAW project, and is also a lecturer with the School of Computer Science
                        at University College Cork in Ireland. Klaas has published several papers on InnerSource (see "Related Publications"),
                        and also co-authored the book <a href="https://innersourcecommons.org/learn/books/adopting-innersource-principles-and-case-studies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adopting InnerSource: Principles and Case Studies</a> with Danese Cooper;
                        he is a Member of the <a href="https://innersourcecommons.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">InnerSource Commons</a>.

                <p>
                    <a id="withdraw"><b>Q: Can I withdraw from the study?</b></a>
                        A: You may withdraw from the study at any time without any consequences, up to two weeks after the data collection has completed (which is two weeks after Round 3 closes).
                        In that event, any data that we may have collected from you will be deleted. You do not have to provide any reason for this.
